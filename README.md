# Hi!

- 👋 Hi, my name is Cristovão,  I'm 19 years old, and I'm a developer from Brazil! I am "Técnico em Informática Integrado ao Ensino Médio" by "IFPB - Campus Esperança" and I study Computer Science at "UFCG - Universidade Federal de Campina Grande". Currently, I'm working as a front-end developer with ReactJS at Diletta Solutions.

- On my github you'll find a lot of simple projects that are focused on especific concepts of the technologies I'm studying.

- These are my main technologies:

  - ReactJS
  - Javascript / Typescript
