# Hi!

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is CristovÃ£o,  I'm 19 years old, and I'm a developer from Brazil! I am "TÃ©cnico em InformÃ¡tica Integrado ao Ensino MÃ©dio" by "IFPB - Campus EsperanÃ§a" and I study Computer Science at "UFCG - Universidade Federal de Campina Grande".

- Now I'm studying back-end development and Unix systems.

- Currently, one of my focuses is to study web development always trying to think outside of the box to provide the fastest and the best development experience in my personal projects.

- On my github you'll find a lot of simple projects that are focused on especific concepts of the technologies I'm studying.

- These are my main technologies:

  - ReactJS
  - Javascript / Typescript
